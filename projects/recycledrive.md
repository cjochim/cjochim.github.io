During my school's spirit week, each grade level competed in donating the most recycled cans/bottles and money. Each bottle/can counts as 5 cents added to the grade level's total. To motivate students to donate, each student in the winning grade level earns a free boba. The recycle drive was a success with a total donation of $4,273.81 to a selected charity. 

My job in this project was to count the money and cans donated, and to record and organize the data on Excel. The most difficult part was counting the money by hand and counting over 4,000 cans/bottles. Two other fellow students helped count and double check any miscounting. I learned how to persude the students to donate and it was a great experience using Excel.
