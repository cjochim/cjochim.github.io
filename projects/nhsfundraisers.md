I was treasurer in the National Honors Society (NHS) council, and I supervised and participated in the fundraising committee. During the school year of 2020-2021, the NHS hosted a number of fundraisers. My job was to bookkeep all of the deposits and expenses from each fundraiser. 

## Wreath Charity Fundraiser
During the Christmas season, we hosted a Wreath Charity Fundraiser. We encouraged NHS members, students, teachers, and many people outside of school to purchase wreaths. The fundraiser was during the time of COVID-19, so it was difficult to persuade people to buy wreaths. However, we collected $2,802.28. I was in charge of obtaining cash receipts from checks.
