StackOverflow is a forum where many programmers ask hackers and the pros for help or advice on computer programming topics. Although many are looking for help, there’s people who ask smart questions and receive answers, and there’s people who ask stupid questions and receive nothing but an eyeroll and possibly a sarcastic chuckle. While reading (article), I question if I ask in the smart or stupid way.  

*NOTICE* I'm clearly not done with this essay but I hope to finish it by the end of the day!
