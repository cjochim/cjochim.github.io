## Introduction
Since I enjoyed 314: Introduction to Software Engineering, I decided to enroll in 414: Software Engineering II for my final semester, and it’s a decision I’m glad I made! I enjoy collaborating with (strong, decent) teams because it provides a glimpse into a real-world work environment alongside others in the same field. This was especially true in 414, where we had the opportunity to work with an actual client—Spire Hawaii, an accounting firm.

## Project Overview
The primary objective was to enhance Spire’s existing accounting model, which heavily depended on Excel spreadsheets for financial and strategic decision-making, resulting in inefficient and cumbersome management processes. The goal was to develop an interactive website that would seamlessly integrate with the Excel spreadsheets for a more efficient digital experience and workflow. The website aimed to modernize the traditional spreadsheet-based approach by offering a user-friendly web interface, enabling users to quickly and easily visualize key financial insights.

## The Project Team
Unlike 314, where we could form our own teams, 414 assigned teams randomly, simulating a real-world work environment where you don’t choose your colleagues and must adapt to the group. The project team consisted of eight members. Fortunately, I was lucky to be part of an excellent team. Everyone contributed actively and communicated effectively. Although coordinating schedules was challenging due to the size of the group, the majority of us attended most meetings, whether in person or via Discord.

## Contributions
The project was heavily focused on backend development, particularly syncing CSV files with our application and replicating Excel’s functionality for data input and modeling. I’ll admit that backend work isn’t my strongest area, but fortunately, most of my team excelled in that domain. While the backend was the most difficult portion with significant challenges, I focused on contributing through frontend development and supporting my teammates whenever they needed assistance.

I collaborated with another team member on the frontend, where we brainstormed ways to make the webpage both user-friendly and visually appealing. My specific contributions included implementing the carousel and designing the contents of each slide. Additionally, I worked on the navbar, fixed the links for the graph dashboards and CSV page, and made other minor adjustments to enhance the user experience. Unfortunately, balancing this project with four other project-based courses limited the time I could dedicate. I had more ideas for improvements, but time constraints prevented me from fulfilling them. Despite this, I’m proud of the work I was able to contribute and the overall success of the project.

## Conclusion
Overall, this was one of my favorite classes this semester. I want to give a shoutout to each member of my group for being truly amazing teammates.
