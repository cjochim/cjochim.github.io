As a newbie to the computer science community, I can say that JavaScript is an easier language to understand compared to the other languages I learned – C and Java. JavaScript is one of the core technologies in the World Wide Web, so it can be a great language to a software engineering perspective. JavaScript is constantly evolving with the addition of powerful, new features that can aid experienced and inexperienced programmers. 
Because I spent my first year of ICS learning Java and I spent a semester of ICS learning C, I am more familiar with Java. Comparing Java to JavaScript, Java is more defined in which data types need to be statically typed, whereas the variables in JavaScript can be loosely typed in which the variables do not need to be declared. JavaScript is more fluid for my programming style. Moreover, I noticed that JavaScript can be more forgiving with its flexible syntax. 
To a software engineering perspective, JavaScript is a great programming language. Since JavaScript is web based and designed to run in a browser, learning JavaScript is great for engineers who want to create and design web pages or apps that run through websites. On the other hand, Java is great for creating programs that do not rely on a browser such as app designing. Comparing the two languages, JavaScript can be seen as more of a scripting language than a programming language because an existing system interprets the code. 
During the first week of ICS 314, I was introduced to the concept of athletic software engineering. The goal of athletic software engineering is to develop skills in efficiency and speed. To develop and strengthen athletic engineering skills, practice WODs are given which is helpful because the more practice, the better. Initially, I thought performing a timed programming prompt could induce sloppy code. However, with more practice, fluency and good quality code can result from athletic engineering. 
Honestly, the concept of athletic software engineering generates trepidation, especially as a new coder. The timer counting down to zero is my opponent, and anxiety and “coding block” are my obstacles. Although the practice WODs help, I fear that in an actual WOD, my mind will go blank. Despite the worrying, I have come to think that just as the name implies, athletic software engineering is like a sport. With more practice and developing new skills, I will eventually know how to approach a prompt and solve it within a given time limit. Overcoming the time limit is rewarding, and trying to beat a personal record can be fun yet stressful.
